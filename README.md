# sarf, simple archive format for unix

SARF, helps you manipulate archive files with the .sarf extension. The archives it creates only stores the files, meaning there is no compression applied.

### Only for UNIX
Currently, SARF is only supported by unix based systems (MacOS, Linux). That's because it uses c libraries that are only available on unix.

### Dependencies
SARF's only dependency is the C language to be installed on your system.
